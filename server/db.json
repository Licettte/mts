    "description": "Raise a family with children, experiment with genetic modifications, and command your own mechanoid army and workforce.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raise a family</h2>Have children and raise a family through natural or artificial means. Colonists could give birth or use a surrogate mother, take in a band of orphans, and even gestate embryos in machines. Play matchmaker with your colonists, or let their relationships grow organically. Prepare for labor and childcare, and get ready to welcome your little ones to the world!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Care for your babies</h2>Keep your baby’s tummy full with lots of good eats, decorate an adorable nursery for playtime, and build a comfortable crib for a good night’s rest. Happy babies make for happy colonists.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Watch over your children</h2>Give your children a rich and happy childhood by balancing their life between work and play. Help kids fulfill their learning desires by letting them explore nature, chat on the radio, spend time in class, daydream, scribble, and watch the grown-ups at work. Choose your children’s traits and passions at certain ages - the healthier their upbringing, the greater the variety of traits and passions to pick from. <br><br><br>Growth vats offer a cheaper alternative to normal child raising. Use vats to accelerate your children’s development to quickly churn out dumb soldiers and simple workers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Genetic modification</h2>Create your own genetically-modified colonists known as xenohumans. Curate a collection of exotic genes by purchasing them from traders, accepting them as quest rewards, or extracting them from your menagerie of xenohuman prisoners. Recombine genes to make bizarre and advantageous mixes of traits, and build your colony of xenohumans!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet new xenohuman factions</h2>Engage with new factions consisting of exotic xenohumans. Xenohuman factions include hardy pig-people, poison-drinking waster pirates, unforgiving neanderthal hunters, and more. Factions feel different from each other - how you handle a group of frenzied fire-breathers will be different from stopping the wolf escorts sent by fur-bodied riflemen. Some xenohuman cultures are friendly, while others are hostile or prefer to be left alone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join the immortal blood-drinkers</h2>Sanguophages pass among humans undetected while concealing superhuman powers and working to satiate their genetic need for blood. Powered by superintelligent nano-machines, sanguophages are ageless, immortal, preternaturally beautiful, and capable of launching deadly spines and healing allies. You may join their cult if deemed worthy, or force them to grant you immortality.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and control mechanoids</h2>Make your colonist into a mechanitor - a person with a brain implant that lets them psychically command semi-living machines called mechanoids. Create mechanoids by growing them inside high-tech gestator tanks and command a wide variety of new combat and labor mechanoids. <br><br><br>Build a mechanoid army and experiment with a variety of battle tactics using swarms of cheap, disposable gunners, tanky defenders, shield-projecting snipers, flame-spitters, and more. At home, make mechanoid workers that can manufacture goods, rescue and tend to colonists, build and repair structures, sow and harvest crops, haul stuff, and other tasks. Grow your swarm and upgrade your mechanitor into an unstoppable mechlord.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenge super-mechanoid bosses</h2>Call down three new super-mechanoid bosses to fight. Defeat these super-deadly enemies and their escorts and harvest special mechanoid chips from their smoking husks to advance your mechanoid technology.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adapt to pollution</h2>Your mechanoid infrastructure produces toxic wastepacks. Left unfrozen, waste deteriorates and leaks pollutants into the environment. Pollution poisons your colonists, mutates plants and animals, blocks the sunlight, and attracts giant hostile insects. Manage your waste, or embrace pollution with new gear, detoxifier organs, and genetic modifications.",

You will need to rely on your teammates if you want to survive the most hostile cave systems in the galaxy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4 UNIQUE CLASSES</h2>Pick the right class for the job. Mow through enemies as the Gunner, scout ahead and light up the caves as the Scout, chew through solid rock as the Driller, or support the team with defensive structures and turrets as the Engineer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FULLY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS</h2>Destroy everything around you to reach your goal. There is no set path so you can complete your mission your way. Drill straight down to your objective or build an intricate network of paths to explore your surroundings -- the choice is yours. But proceed with caution, you don’t want to stumble into an alien swarm unprepared!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROCEDURALLY GENERATED CAVE NETWORK</h2>Explore a network of procedurally generated cave systems filled with enemies to fight and riches to collect. There’s always something new to discover and no two playthroughs are alike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HIGH-TECH GADGETS AND WEAPONS</h2>Dwarves know what they need to bring to get the job done. This means the most powerful weapons and the most advanced gadgets around - flamethrowers, gatling guns, portable platform launchers, and much, much more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LIGHT YOUR PATH</h2>The underground caves are dark and full of terrors. You will need to bring your own lights if you want to illuminate these pitch-black caverns.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/548430/extras/SteamStore_VignetteA_01.png?t=1709748678\" />",

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller</strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers</strong> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fludeon.com%2Fforums%2Findex.php%3Fboard%3D15.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >active mod community</a>.

    "description": "Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540\" /><br>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br><br><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540\" /><br>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br><br><strong>REPEAT</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540\" /><br>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.",

They invoke rituals from gentle festivals to brutal sacrifices. They guide preferences around food, comfort, love, technology, and violence. They venerate specific animals, desire different apparel and tattoos, and give access to different buildings and strategies.<br><br>Everything is customizable. Make your own story of pirate nudist cannibals, blind undergrounder mole people, charitable ranching cowboys, machine-obsessed transhumanists, or rustic peaceful tribes who link with curious tree creatures.<br><br>You can build mind-bending temples with colorful drug motifs, terrifying sacrificial altars clad in skulls, winding mazes of underground tunnels full of technology, or beautiful orchards with drifting leaves.<br><br>You’ll hold unforgettable rituals - sick dance parties with pounding music, bountiful feasts of human flesh, beautiful skylantern festivals, ceremonial blindings, Christmas festivities around the tree, vicious gladiator duels, and more.<br><br>As you grow powerful, you’ll hunt for the venerated relics of your belief system in new multi-part quests. Penetrate ancient complexes full of diverse threats. Infiltrate wary tribal villages and hack downed spacedrones while holding off other treasure-hunters. Find the relic in its ancient temple and bring it back to your reliquary to attract wealthy pilgrims to your colony and help you convert even more people to your beliefs.<br><br>And when you’re successful and secure, you can seek transcendence beyond reality in the new, epic archonexus endgame.<br><br>Ideology makes your story into <i>your story</i> more than ever before.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/memes.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Each belief system is built around a collection of 1-4 core memes, where each <strong>meme</strong> represents a core idea in the belief system. By combining memes and changing the details of how they are expressed, you can create a near-infinite variety of different belief systems.<br><br>The memes are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Animal personhood:</strong> Animals have rights as humans do.<br></li><li><strong>Rancher:</strong> Raising animals is the right way; raising plants to eat is not.<br></li><li><strong>Pain is virtue:</strong> Virtue is shown through the suffering of self and others.<br></li><li><strong>Darkness:</strong> Bright light burns and destroys! Darkness nourishes and creates. People ought to live in darkness.<br></li><li><strong>Tunneler:</strong> Humans ought to live underground, and enjoy the succulent fruit of the depths.<br></li><li><strong>Tree connection:</strong> Trees are the essence of life, and we must be near them.<br></li><li><strong>Nudism:</strong> Clothing binds, controls, and suffocates us. We should all hang free.<br></li><li><strong>Blindsight:</strong> Only the blind can perceive true reality. <br></li><li><strong>Cannibal:</strong> We must consume human flesh.<br></li><li><strong>Transhumanist:</strong> Human progress means merging with technology.<br></li><li><strong>Flesh purity:</strong> The human body should not be debased.<br></li><li><strong>Raider:</strong> The strong should take from the weak. <br></li><li><strong>Proselytizer:</strong> It is our duty to spread our beliefs.<br></li><li><strong>High life:</strong> Exotic states of mind are central to a good life.<br></li><li><strong>Nature primacy:</strong> Man is a stain on nature's perfection.<br></li><li><strong>Human primacy:</strong> Humans are the moral center of the universe.<br></li><li><strong>Female supremacy:</strong> Women are the superior gender and should rule.<br></li><li><strong>Male supremacy:</strong> Men are the superior gender and should rule. <br></li><li><strong>Supremacist:</strong> Our people should dominate all others.<br></li><li><strong>Loyalist:</strong> We stand for our own before others.<br></li><li><strong>Guilty:</strong> Our people carry guilt from ages past. Others are more worthy.<br></li><li><strong>Individualist:</strong> A community's role is to serve each individual.<br></li><li><strong>Collectivist:</strong> A person's role is to serve the community.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/precepts.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Each meme can give rise to a variety of different <strong>precepts</strong>. Each precept is a specific rule or guideline which affects a specific behavior or preference. The same meme won’t always imply the same precepts - if you want fine control, you can edit and randomize precepts exactly the way you like. Some precepts relate to issues like:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Eating nutrient paste:</strong> This meal can be seen as disgusting or efficient.<br></li><li><strong>Cannibalism:</strong> Some believers find eating human flesh abhorrent, others are unbothered, and some hunger for it.  <br></li><li><strong>Insect meat:</strong> The slimy flesh of insects can be gross or delectable. <br></li><li><strong>Fungus eating:</strong> Mushy fungus food, which can now be farmed underground on fungal gravel, is preferred by some and hated by others.<br></li><li><strong>Organ use:</strong> Opinions differ on the harvest, sale, purchase, and installation of organs. <br></li><li><strong>Execution:</strong> This act is potentially evil beyond measure, necessary, and even enjoyed. <br></li><li><strong>Venerated animal:</strong> A certain animal is believed to have a special moral role. Therefore, it must never be harmed, and people are happier with it around. <br></li><li><strong>Animal connection:</strong> Some belief systems have a strong connection to animals and consider them friends.<br></li><li><strong>Slaughtering animals:</strong> It may be necessary for food, but others strongly disapprove.<br></li><li><strong>Apostasy:</strong> Abandoning one’s belief system indicates character flaws or deep immorality. <br></li><li><strong>Autonomous weapons:</strong> Views vary on whether machines should be allowed to decide who to kill.<br></li><li><strong>Blindness:</strong> Some people believe that to be blinded is to be moral and unclouded by physical reality. Others disagree.<br></li><li><strong>Blind psysense:</strong> Blind individuals have special ways to connect to the psychic aether. <br></li><li><strong>Body modification:</strong> Some demand modified bodies, while others abhor them.<br></li><li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Some believe forming personal bonds with animals is good - others don’t.<br></li><li><strong>Charity:</strong> Charitable belief systems emphasize the importance of generosity and helping others.<br></li><li><strong>Men/women’s spouses:</strong> Rules exist regarding how many spouses a man or woman can have. <br></li><li><strong>Physical love:</strong> Restrictions on intimate life.<br></li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Some pay no attention to comfort.<br></li><li><strong>Slab bed:</strong> Some think the proper way to sleep is on a cold, uncomfortable slab. <br></li><li><strong>Corpses:</strong> Seeing the dead may be disturbing to colonists or it may not bother them at all.<br></li><li><strong>Drug use:</strong> Drugs may be prohibited, limited to medical and social use, or essential.<br></li><li><strong>Diversity of thought:</strong> Varies widely from deep appreciation to intense bigotry. <br></li><li><strong>Killing innocent animals:</strong> Such acts may be disapproved, hated, or unthinkable. <br></li><li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Those adjusted to the darkness have a preference for darklights. <br></li><li><strong>Darkness combat:</strong> Some believers fight better in the dark.<br></li><li><strong>Meat-eating:</strong> Colonies might be strict about following a carnivore diet, or reject it completely.<br></li><li><strong>Mining:</strong> Raiding the earth of its resources is an ugly act. <br></li><li><strong>Male/female clothing:</strong> Opinions differ on which parts of the body should be covered.<br></li><li><strong>Pain:</strong> To suffer and undergo violent, nerve-singing pain is to be moral.<br></li><li><strong>Proselytizing:</strong> Spreading your beliefs may be an occasional task or your ultimate duty.<br></li><li><strong>Raiding:</strong> The strong take from the weak. Failing to do so means that you are also weak. <br></li><li><strong>Ranching:</strong> The right way to live is to raise large animals for their meat. Crops have no place here.<br></li><li><strong>Research:</strong> Expanding one’s knowledge may be trivial or crucial to a colony.<br></li><li><strong>Scarification:</strong> Some belief systems value ritual scars on the body, while others deplore the idea.<br></li><li><strong>Skullspike:</strong> Not all enjoy collecting skulls and sticking them on pikes. But some do.<br></li><li><strong>Slavery:</strong> Belief systems have different views on the ownership and trade of slaves.<br></li><li><strong>Small spaces:</strong> Some people have no issue with claustrophobic spaces. <br></li><li><strong>Sleep accelerator:</strong> To sleep without an accelerator would be foolish and a waste of time.<br></li><li><strong>Biosculpting:</strong> Biosculpting is demanded by some believers, whereas others feel it violates the body.<br></li><li><strong>Age reversal:</strong> Why would you ever get old if you had the power to reverse it?<br></li><li><strong>Neural supercharger:</strong> Some think it’s degrading to live without having their brain constantly supercharged by technology.<br></li><li><strong>Cutting trees:</strong> Some may grow upset when trees are cut down, to varying degrees.<br></li><li><strong>Trees:</strong> Believers want to be surrounded by nature and grand forests.<br></li><li><strong>Gauranlen connection:</strong> Some belief systems have a much stronger connection to the Gauranlen trees and their dryads.<br></li><li><strong>Weapons:</strong> There are preferences for weapons. Some are noble and sought after, others are despised.<br></li><li><strong>Work drive:</strong> The leader’s work drive ability is tripled.</li></ul><br>Belief systems each have an underlying <strong>structure.</strong> These don’t have gameplay effects, but they give variety to how different belief systems look and feel, and the narratives the game generates for them:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Ideological</strong> beliefs are justified by historical narratives.<br></li><li><strong>Theistic</strong> beliefs may be monotheistic or polytheistic, seeing their gods as abstract or physically-embodied. Some may be distant descendants of historical belief systems.<br></li><li><strong>Animist </strong>beliefs see spirits in the world around us.<br></li><li><strong>Archist</strong> beliefs see the superintelligent machine archotechs as the true gods of reality.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/conversion.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>People can convert each other to new beliefs. You can assign wardens to convert prisoners, or use the special abilities of your moral guide.<br><br>People will also spontaneously try to convert those around them. Those with proselytizing beliefs will do this much more intensely - which can lead to conflict.<br><br>Depending on traits, some people are much easier to convert than others.<br><br>You can bring everyone in your colony to one belief system, or try to keep a diversity of beliefs to capture the benefits of all of them.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/Social_roles.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Make use of your favourite colonists’ strengths and skills by assigning them formal social roles. Each belief system defines special roles that believers can take on.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The <strong>leader</strong> role gives inspirational speeches, buffs combat allies around them, encourages harder work, and plays a special role in some rituals. They can also accuse individuals of crimes and hold trials.<br></li><li>The <strong>moral</strong> guide role supports the mental well-being and spiritual strength of your people, and leads many rituals including funerals, sacrifices, and more. They can preach health to the sick to speed up healing, provide counsel to sad colonists to lift their moods, reassure people in their beliefs, and convert non-believers to their own belief system.<br></li><li>The <strong>specialist</strong> role gives better effectiveness at one primary skill and gains a special ability related to that skill. As a tradeoff, specialists become more focused on their specific skill and won’t do some other work. You can assign many specialists.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/rituals.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Each belief system defines a collection of unique <strong>rituals.</strong> These player-controlled events are special gatherings that have a variety of impacts depending on how they are carried out. For example, a wild party in a massive dance hall with giant speakers may attract new recruits or lead to the discovery of an ancient complex full of loot. On the other hand, if you throw a party in a field with no music at all, you might not get the same benefits.<br><br>Belief system-based rituals include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dance party:</strong> Participants dance to music from giant speakers, illuminated by a colorful lightball.<br></li><li><strong>Drum party:</strong> Drummers make music as others dance the night away.<br></li><li><strong>Social festivals:</strong> The leader gives a speech and then people gather to drink and socialize.<br></li><li><strong>Tree celebration:</strong> A social festival around a decorated tree.<br></li><li><strong>Burn circle:</strong> A moral leader gives a condemnatory speech, and the people burn a hated symbol like an effigy or flag.<br></li><li><strong>Smoke circle:</strong> People burn a special giant bong or incense shrine and inhale the smoke together.<br></li><li><strong>Skylantern festival:</strong> People build and release beautiful wooden lanterns that float into the sky.<br></li><li><strong>Gladiator duel:</strong> Slaves or prisoners fight in a ring to entertain spectators. You can supply weapons and they will be used. If a fighter dies, the crowd will come away even more excited.<br></li><li><strong>Sacrifice:</strong> A moral leader kills an animal or prisoner before a crowd.<br></li><li><strong>Cannibal feast:</strong> Colonists gather to devour a scrumptious platter of human meat.<br></li><li><strong>Scarification:</strong> The moral guide inducts a new believer by aesthetically scarring them while others watch.<br></li><li><strong>Blinding:</strong> The moral guide inducts a new believer by blinding them while others watch.<br></li><li><strong>Funeral:</strong> People gather around a grave to remember someone they lost, while a moral guide gives a speech.</li></ul><br>Some rituals aren’t specific to belief systems:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Leader speeches:</strong> The colony’s leader gives a rousing speech intended to boost morale. If their social skills fail, it might have the opposite effect!<br></li><li><strong>Trial:</strong> The leader accuses someone of heinous crimes. The accuser and accused argue the case in front of witnesses. If convicted, the accused can be punished without social consequences.<br></li><li><strong>Public execution:</strong> A killing of a prisoner. This goes best after a trial where the prisoner is found guilty of something.<br></li><li><strong>Tree connection:</strong> A majestic ceremony where a colonist connects with a Gauranlen tree, giving them the ability to command the dryads inside. </li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/gauranlentrees.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>A unique type of tree called the Gauranlen tree will occasionally sprout near your colony. These majestic orange trees have a symbiotic relationship with small creatures called dryads. The tree supports the dryads, and in return the dryads protect the tree. Each tree has a few dryads attached to it.<br><br>A colonist can connect with a tree in a special ceremony. By pruning the tree over time, the colonist can strengthen the connection and gain the ability to influence its dryads.<br><br>Under your influence, dryads can specialize into different castes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Carrier:</strong> These chunky helpers will haul things where they need to go.<br></li><li><strong>Clawer:</strong> Vulnerable but fearsome, the clawer specializes in damage dealing.<br></li><li><strong>Barkskin:</strong> Slow but tough, the barkskin soaks hits for your other fighters.<br></li><li><strong>Woodmaker:</strong> Generates wood over time.<br></li><li><strong>Medicinemaker:</strong> Generates herbal medicine over time.<br></li><li><strong>Berrymaker:</strong> Generates berries over time.<br></li><li><strong>Gaumaker:</strong> Produces Gauranlen sprouts to make new Gauranlen trees.</li></ul><br>Beliefs matter. If your colonists venerate the trees, they can connect with Gauranlen trees more effectively and influence the dryads more efficiently. Only those who truly respect the trees can control their reproduction. With time, such a tree-connector colony can build an economy and an army from its Gauranlen orchard and the cute, useful, fearsome dryads.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/relichunts.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Every belief system holds some special objects as relics. It might be an ancient sword, a skull, a piece of armor, or anything else. Embark on multi-part quests to find and collect the relics that you believe in.<br><br>Hunting a relic involves several kinds of quests to find the relic:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Ancient complex</strong> quests take you to long-forgotten ruins containing treasure and info about the relic. A wide variety of challenges may await you - cryptosleeping soldiers, insects, sleeping mechanoids, unstable fuel stores, or pirates who followed you to the site. Use these threats against each other to survive while taking what you want.<br></li><li><strong>Spacedrone</strong> quests begin with an spacedrone landing beside your colony. It contains info on a relic, but you’ll have to hack it first! Build defenses on the spot to protect yourself against other treasure hunters while you extract the info.<br></li><li><strong>Worshipped terminal</strong> quests involve an ancient terminal venerated by a tribal village. They will allow you to visit, but attempting to hack the terminal will cause the locals to attack. Consider launching an attack from outside the village, or enter peacefully and try for a smash-and-grab. It’s your choice.</li></ul>Once you’ve found the <strong>ancient temple</strong> that holds the relic, you can go there and grab it in a daring raid as you evade and defeat a variety of security systems. Take it home and install it in a reliquary. The relic will help you turn others to your beliefs, and also attract <strong>pilgrims</strong> who will bring gifts.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/additionalquests.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Ideology also adds some new quests not related to the relics.<br><br><strong>Ancient complex loot</strong> quests see you raiding loot-filled ancient complexes, either in a shuttle or by traveling in a caravan. These ancient complexes aren’t about finding a relic - just about getting rich. Complexes are procedurally-generated and contain a wide variety of threats. The threats are designed to interact with each other and even be useful - You can intentionally wake sleeping ancient soldiers to help fight pirates who followed you to the complex, or ignite an ancient fuel node to burn out giant insects nesting in the next room. It can get pretty crazy - this is RimWorld, after all.<br><br><strong>New temporary encampments</strong> will set up near your colony. These small communities are lightly-defended and often not associated with any larger faction, making them good targets if you want to become a raider yourself. Beliefs matter - If your beliefs are aggressive, your colonists may even demand this kind of attack be carried out regularly to satisfy their need for dominance. The encampments vary from farms to logging sites, mines, and hunting lodges, each with different kinds of defenders and loot.<br><br>Groups of <strong>beggars</strong> will arrive and ask for aid. Help them, and they might reward you later. You can also choose to betray them and enslave them, recruit them, sell them, or anything else. Beliefs matter - if your beliefs are charitable, your colonists will be especially happy when you take care of the needy travelers.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/newbuildings.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>Belief systems unlock new buildings.<br><br>Many of the buildings are used to support rituals. These include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Altar:</strong> Traditional platforms used in rituals. These are the center of your ritual hall.<br></li><li><strong>Ideogram:</strong> Arcane symbols on the floor that are used in rituals. <br></li><li><strong>Lectern:</strong> Give your rituals a formal look with this slanted stand.

Styles affect how many things look - rituals, furniture, floors, apparel, and art. Your colonists will enjoy being around things that match the styles of their belief system, and some may reject styles of other beliefs.<br><br>Styles include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Rustic:</strong> The homey country ranch look.<br></li><li><strong>Totemic:</strong> A tribal-inspired look.<br></li><li><strong>Spikecore:</strong> The spiky space pirate look.<br></li><li><strong>Morbid:</strong> Skull-and-death imagery for those dark cults.<br></li><li><strong>Techist:</strong> Technological motifs everywhere - circuits and hexes.<br></li><li><strong>Animalist:</strong> Animal motifs.<br></li><li><strong>Hindu:</strong> Descendant of ancient Hindu imagery.<br></li><li><strong>Christian:</strong> Descendant of ancient Christian imagery.<br></li><li><strong>Islamic:</strong> Descendant of ancient Islamic imagery.<br></li><li><strong>Buddhist:</strong> Descendant of ancient Buddhist imagery.</li></ul><br>One belief system can mix-and-match several of these together. Make the morbid pirates or techno-Buddhists you dream of.<br><br>Styles affect apparel in many ways. Animalist believers may shape their recon armor helmets as terrifying animal faces. Morbid death-worshippers will use skull helmets. Spikecore pirates will wear dusters with spiked shoulders. There are many, many visual variations, so every colony will dress different.<br><br>Styles also affect the artwork your colony produces. Statues will display the iconography of their creators’ belief systems.<br><br>Some styles also come with specific floors including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Morbid tiles</strong> and <strong>carpets</strong> with horror skulls.<br></li><li><strong>Spikecore tiles</strong> and <strong>plates.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Totemic tile</strong> and <strong>boards.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Hex carpets</strong> and <strong>tiles</strong> for a techist look.<br></li><li><strong>Mindbend carpets</strong> for those seeking spirits in the smoke.</li></ul><br>Styles are also expressed in new decorative floor coverings:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Spikecore floor stars</strong> for your gladiator arena.<br></li><li><strong>Rustic rugs</strong> for that farmhouse look.<br></li><li><strong>Morbid, totemic,</strong> and <strong>animalist slabs</strong> for those central points in the colony.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/apparel.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br><br>Beyond styles, belief systems can make people want to wear specific items of apparel. Some of these can be specific to certain social roles as well - a priest or moral leader may need to wear a special hat or robe.<br><br>Ideology includes a variety of new apparel items believers might want:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Authority caps:</strong> Enhance the ability to suppress slaves.<br></li><li><strong>Tailcaps:</strong> For the outdoorsy look.<br></li><li><strong>Burkas:</strong> Full body cover.<br></li><li><strong>Flophats:</strong> Relaxed headwear.<br></li><li><strong>Slicecaps:</strong> High-tech headwear.<br></li><li><strong>Shadecones:</strong> Look good in the sun.<br></li><li><strong>Visage masks:</strong> Cover the face entirely.<br></li><li><strong>Torture crowns:</strong> Add pain, for those who want to suffer.<br></li><li><strong>Robes:</strong> For the solemn look.<br></li><li><strong>Headwraps and broadwraps:</strong> Traditional head coverings.</li></ul><br>Colonists also want new <strong>tattoos</strong> and <strong>beards</strong> and <strong>hairstyles</strong> related to their beliefs. They can visit a <strong>styling station</strong> to recolor garments using dyes harvested from the new tinctoria crop, change tattoos, or restyle their beard and hair.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/slaves.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>You can enslave prisoners or purchase slaves from traders. Slaves will work on most tasks like colonists, at the cost of reduced work speed.<br><br>Every belief system has an attitude towards slavery - some find the practice abhorrent, while others accept and even demand slaves as part of their beliefs.<br><br>You can arm your slaves and command them directly in combat. But watch out - slaves will rebel if they get the opportunity or they are not sufficiently suppressed. Your wardens can suppress slaves by periodically threatening them. You can use structures like terror statues and gibbet cages to passively suppress slaves. You can also make slaves wear special collars and body straps to keep them under control.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392840/extras/archonexus_endgame.jpg?t=1676391392\" /><br>As your colony grows wealthy, you’ll have the opportunity to sell the whole thing and start anew with your favorite colonists and animals. In return, you’ll receive a piece of a map that leads to the <strong>archonexus</strong> - a conduit through which an ancient machine superintelligence is said to affect the physical world.<br><br>This quest acts like a partial game reset where you will start over with your selected colonists and animals. You can keep your favorite characters while moving to a new colony in a new place and progressing on an epic quest.<br><br>Each new colony appears next to an ancient archotech structure of increasing psychic influence. Study each structure to unlock further pieces of the map. Unlock three pieces, and you can locate the archonexus itself, invoke its power, and transcend physical reality through the mind of the machine god. <br><br>Enjoy the endgame credits to a new epic song by Alistair Lindsay.<br><br>(All non-English translations are made by fans.)",
